-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Code Insititue black, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Arial font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Helvetica and Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Arial is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The Hero Image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
